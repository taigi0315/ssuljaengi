Here is the rewritten feature request list for version 0.0.2, organized clearly in Markdown. I have corrected the grammar, grouped related tasks, and standardized the technical terminology to make it ready for your documentation or issue tracker.

# Feature List v0.0.2

## 1. Audio & SFX Engineering

- **Fix Missing SFX Implementation:** Investigate the current audio pipeline. Sound effects (SFX) are currently missing from the final output (both image and audio generation stages).
- _Action:_ Verify if the SFX application code exists. If it exists, debug why it is not rendering. If missing, implement the SFX layering module.

## 2. Visual Pacing & Effects

- **Optimize Image Duration (Pacing):** The current image duration (6–10 seconds) is too slow and harms viewer retention.
- _Requirement:_ Update the `Scriptwriter` or `Evaluator` to enforce a maximum duration of **3–4 seconds per image**.
- _Goal:_ Create a more dynamic visual flow to keep the audience engaged.

- **Refine & Diversify Visual Effects (VFX):**
- _Issue:_ The "Shake" effect is currently too aggressive and lasts too long (causing viewer discomfort/motion sickness).
- _Fix:_ Limit the duration of high-intensity effects via the `Evaluator`.
- _Expansion:_ Implement variable movement types (Zoom In/Out, Pan Left/Right, Slow/Fast Shake) and expose this list to the LLM so it can choose appropriate effects for the scene.

## 3. Character & Asset Generation

- **Standardize Character Sheet Generation:**
- _Issue:_ Some character generations are inconsistent (blending into the background rather than acting as a reference design).
- _Requirement:_ Update the image generation prompt to strictly produce **Character Design Sheets** (showing front/back views and varying facial expressions).
- _Note:_ User will provide the specific prompt logic, but the system must be ready to integrate it.

- **Implement Webtoon-Style Panel Layouts:**
- _Requirement:_ Move beyond single images to vertical "Webtoon" style paneling.
- _Implementation:_ Create fixed templates (e.g., Template A: 3 vertical split, Template B: 4 vertical split).
- _Workflow:_ The `Scriptwriter` will select a template (e.g., "Use 3-panel split"), and the image prompt generator will populate each section of the template with specific scene descriptions and bubble placement instructions.

## 4. Scripting & Narrative Architecture

- **Enhance Narrative Dramatization (The "Hook"):**
- _Requirement:_ The `Scriptwriter` must restructure stories to maximize engagement (Likes/Dislikes/Comments).
- _Strategy:_
- **The Hook:** Move the most dramatic/shocking moment to the first 0–3 seconds of the video.
- **The Ending:** End with an open-ended question or a controversial statement to provoke comments.
- **Tone:** Avoid flat retelling; emphasize conflict ("Two halves of the people get involved").

- **High-Impact Text Overlays:**
- _Requirement:_ Improve subtitle overlays for dramatic emphasis.
- _Style:_ Use bold fonts, larger sizing, and strong/random "irritating" colors (e.g., bright reds/yellows) for high-impact words (screaming, "WTF" moments).

## 5. Metadata & Engagement (YouTube)

- **Source Attribution (Metadata):**
- _Requirement:_ Automatically include the original Reddit thread URL in the YouTube video description.

- **Pinned Comment Strategy:**
- _Goal:_ Drive engagement by directing viewers to the original story.
- _Manual Process (Immediate):_ Manually pin a comment linking to the original thread asking for thoughts.
- _Automated Process (Future Ticket):_ Create a ticket to automate pinning the first comment via the YouTube API after upload.

## 6. Source Discovery (Scraper Expansion)

- **Expand Subreddit Source List:**
- _Issue:_ Sourcing solely from one thread makes it difficult to find stories that fit the 1–2 minute format.
- _Action:_ Update the discovery module/scraper to pull stories from the following subreddits:
- `r/JUSTNOMIL`
- `r/EntitledParents`
- `r/MildlyNoMIL`
- `r/RelationshipAdvice`
- `r/PettyRevenge` & `r/ProRevenge`
- `r/TrueOffMyChest`

### Revisions & Grammar Notes

- **"Korean weapon style":** I interpreted this as **"Webtoon style"** based on the context of "panels" and "bubbles."
- **Numbering:** You skipped item #6 in your original text; I have reordered them logically.
- **Terminology:** Changed "Asian" to "Agent" (assuming this was a speech-to-text typo from your previous logs, or meant "AI Agent").

### Next Step

Would you like me to generate the specific **Image Generation Prompt** for the Webtoon Panel templates (Item #3) so we can test the multi-panel layout?
