# Project Work Log

This document records the narrative of changes for the Ssuljaengi project.

## [2025-12-31] Workflow Initialization

- **Action**: Adopted new Agent Behavior Guidelines (`agent/rule.md`) and Workflow (`agent/workflow.md`).
- **Setup**: Initialized `tickets/todo/` and `tickets/done/` directories.
- **Previous Context**:
  - Resolved video duration issue (1h+ -> 30s) by adding `-shortest` flag to FFmpeg.
  - Fixed infinite effect loop by setting `d=1` in Ken Burns effect.
  - Verified output organization (`outputs/{job_id}/`).
  - **Start**: Retroactively created `tickets/done/TICKET-001-fix-video-effects.md`.
  - **Fixed**: Video freeze after 3s (TICKET-002).
    - **Cause**: Mismatched SAR/Pixel Format between static and effect segments.
    - **Fix**: Enforced `setsar=1` and `format=yuv420p` for _all_ segments in `FFmpegBuilder`.
    - **Verification**: Verified command structure ensures consistent properties.
  - **Fixed**: Broken/Corrupt Video File (TICKET-003).
    - **Cause**: Potential timestamp/timebase mismatch in `concat` due to missing `fps` filter in standardization chain.
    - **Fix**: Added `fps={self.fps}` to standardization chain and fixed label collision bug in `_apply_effects`.
    - **Verification**: `tests/repro_broken_video.py` passes with valid output file.
  - **Fixed**: Audio-Visual Sync Lag (TICKET-005).
    - **Cause**: Accumulated rounding errors in video duration (float) vs audio duration caused video to drift ahead of audio.
    - **Fix**: Implemented Frame-Accurate Duration Calculation (DDA) in `VideoAssembler` to lock video segments to cumulative audio timestamps.
    - **Verification**: Logs confirm drift is capped at ±0.5 frames (<16ms).
