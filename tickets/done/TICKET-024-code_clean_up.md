Specially after this whole big changes and also down the road. We are expecting a lot of debuggings and fine-tuning feature improvements and so on and so on we need to number one store every single steps. Specially llm responses needs to be stored. And the prompt that we requested the input and output from burden. Llm for each agent is to restored in one place to make the debugging easier second. We need to be able to spit out every single step as a log messages. To Define where exactly we failed and why there's going to be a lot of Education that we don't know. I'm very fail the more love messages and the more coverages. We are putting it we're going to be able to Find the exact spot where it breaks or acting weird, then expected it third speaking of acting out or unexpected acting we must cover unit test. So if you are seeing any kind of unit test that is not any kind of functions or logic that is not covered by unit test. We need to write up the unit test. Next speaking of the unit test. Obviously. We need to review our code base if it's a real factored it out so we can cover with a unit test. The bigger code spaghetti code is the enemy of agent Vibe coding. So let's make sure while we are developing. We are modularizing it vectoring it object oriented coding obviously the test driven code development. That is going to be our next test before we wrap up this giant work. We want to make sure we are following this ethics so we can continue apply this ethics down the road.
